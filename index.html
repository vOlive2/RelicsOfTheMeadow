    <p class="landing-subtitle" >Once, all lands were bound by threads of order spun by the Silken Dominion.
From their web of cities and courts, the spiders ruled in quiet mastery—through law, trade, and deceit instead of blades. Their influence reached every shore, their contracts touched every crown.
Yet even webs woven from silk can rot. Ambition tore their empire apart, and those who once served beneath them rose against the hand that fed them. Among their subjects stood the Jade Empire, traders whose wealth rivaled kings, and the Crimson Horde, warriors forged in flame. The Dominion favored the merchants, granting them legitimacy and blessing, while scorning the Horde as beasts unworthy of civilization.
The Horde did not forget.
Their vengeance came in fire. The Dominion’s towers burned, and silk ran with blood. For a brief and brutal age, the world belonged to the Crimson Horde—until betrayal and exhaustion shattered them. Banished into the black forests, the survivors starved and splintered, gnawed by hunger and hate.
The Crimson Horde once ruled with feral strength — a tide of fire and fury that scorched through the land. Yet in their exile, the forest turned against them. Starved of food, warmth, and kinship, many of their warriors lost faith. Some wandered too far, drawn by whispers in the rot and light of alien spores… and thus were remade as the Mycelial Monarchy — minds bound by fungi, their hunger replaced by hive devotion. But not all of the Horde perished; a core still lives, iron-hearted and unbroken, clinging to their creed of survival and strength.
Spores and crawling things crept into their flesh, twisting body and mind alike. What should have been their death became rebirth.
From decay rose the Mycelial Monarchy—a hive of beasts ruled by a fungal queen. No longer merely wolves of war, they became plague and purpose incarnate, seeking to spread across the soil until all life pulsed under one hive.
While the world reeled, the Jade Empire ascended.
Their markets thrived where empires fell. Gold replaced steel; diplomacy replaced conquest. Backed by the lingering authority of the Dominion, they became the brokers of civilization. Their trade routes stitched together kingdoms like veins of emerald—beautiful, but binding. All who sought peace or profit eventually bowed to the Empire’s coin.
In time, ruin brought faith.
Amidst the bones of old cathedrals and the ashes of lost cities, a new belief took shape. The Devoured Faith grew from those who saw divinity in decay. They worship not creation, but consumption—believing that only through ruin can the world be reborn. They scavenge the relics of all who came before, stealing not for greed but for devotion, feeding their god through every relic claimed and every ruin purified.
But even amidst the noise of kings, empires, and cults—there rose a whisper of something new.
The Meadowfolk Union was born not from blood or conquest, but from unity. Refugees, rebels, and wanderers gathered in the fields to build something all others had forgotten—home. They rejected thrones and dogma alike, forging democracy from trust and toil. To them, victory is not domination, but survival.
Now, the web trembles again.
The Dominion stirs beneath the soil, the Empire tightens its grasp on gold, and the Horde prepares for vengeance long delayed.
The Monarchy spreads in secret, the Faith hungers for relics divine, and the Union dares to dream of freedom amid the storm.
Each claims to restore the world.
Each believes they are right.
But the truth is far crueler—
the world will not be healed until it has been broken once more.</p>
