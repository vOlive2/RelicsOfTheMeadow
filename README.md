# 🌿 **Relics of the Meadow**

A turn-based strategy game of shifting alliances, ancient artifacts, and ruthless ambition. ⚔️🔥  
In a fractured world ruled by six rival factions —  
**The Crimson Horde**, **The Jade Empire**, **The Mycelid Monarchy**, **The Devoured Faith**, **The Spider Court**, and **The Meadowfolk Union** —  
each fights to claim the lands, relics, and glory that will define their reign. 🏰🌾

Across the realms lie powerful **Relics**, each one **unique** and **bound to a single owner**.  
They can be **claimed**, **stolen**, or **destroyed**, and every relic grants potent abilities that strengthen the faction that wields it. 💎⚡  
Every move matters — every relic shifts the course of war. 🌍🔥
