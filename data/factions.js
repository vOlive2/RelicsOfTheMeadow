Their unity is born not of loyalty, but of wrath—a singular purpose to reclaim and avenge what was taken from them. Once forgotten, they are now the nightmare the six great powers hoped never to remember.\n\nIn gameplay, the Horde excels in overwhelming assault and vengeance-based mechanics. When one of their settlements falls, their power surges in response, turning loss into momentum, burning everything to reclaim their pride.",

    fullLore:
      "When the Horde’s wrath scorched the land, not all who survived clung to vengeance. Some sought meaning in ruin—and found it in the dark mouths of what came next. The Devoured Faith was born from desperation, a cult that turned surrender into sanctity. They believe the world’s decay is divine and that to be consumed—by plague, by war, by the gods themselves—is to achieve purity.\n\nThe Faith thrives beneath cathedrals of bone and fungus, their hymns echoing in caverns carved by hunger. They trade in despair, offering salvation through sacrifice and control through devotion. Their priests wield relics and rot alike, scavenging from what others leave behind. Rather than wage open war, they drift in after destruction, harvesting whatever remains—land, relics, or lives. Their rituals are quiet and unsettling, transforming ruin into resource.\n\nIn gameplay, they alone can steal relics from other factions, feeding their power through theft and devotion. They earn points by scavenging relics and resources from abandoned or devastated regions, turning desolation into strength. Though their rituals may appear ominous, the Faith are not destroyers—they are the quiet cleanup crew of the fallen world, inheritors of what others abandon. Their obsession with relics, however, corrodes their surroundings, slowly draining their resilience as their faith’s hunger spreads across the land.",

      "The Jade Empire thrives on the pulse of trade. To them, profit is not merely power—it is survival. Built upon centuries of mercantile mastery, they dominate diplomacy and commerce alike, holding the world’s economies in their emerald grasp. The frogs, doves, and cranes each serve a distinct role: the frogs are merchants and politicians, the doves handle diplomacy, and the few remaining cranes work as mercenaries protecting the markets.\n\nTheir empire values wealth above all else. If exile promises gold, they will gladly sell peace to the highest bidder. Other factions rely heavily on their networks; should the Jade Empire cut trade with one, others soon follow. This interwoven reliance ensures their control—starvation of supply and alliance alike.\n\nIn gameplay, they dictate trade and diplomacy. The Jade Empire can impose embargoes, grant favor, or manipulate trade to raise or ruin economies. They earn wealth through transactions and alliances, making every move at the table flow through them. Yet their greed makes them vulnerable—should their trade web collapse, so too does their influence.",
