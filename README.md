# ⭐ About the Game

Relics of the Meadow is a single-player world-building strategy sandbox where you start on a tiny 5×5 frontier and grow it tile by tile.
Build homes, tend your economy, craft powerful structures, explore dangerous biomes, discover rare Clearings, and defeat colossal Beasts hiding in the deep.

There are no AI factions — only you, your people, and the mysteries of the land.
